# Papers
- A systematic search is conducted for all CMR-related publications indexed on [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) as of `r Sys.Date()` with a publication date between 2017 and 2024.
- This is achieved with the `pubmedr` package.

# Journals
- Search for journals is conducted on the [Scopus database](https://www.scopus.com/). The search is restricted to the top 10% journals in the *Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine* and *Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging* categories. 
- At present, the list used was obtained manually in August 2024. Use of the Scopus API is in the pipeline with the `rscopus` package.
- Journals are further screened for authors if they published papers relating to cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in the study period (2017-2024).

# Authors
- Unique author names from the collected papers are extracted
- Last authors searched on Scopus with the `rscopus` package
  - Author search on Scopus is limited to last authors with > 1 CMR-related publications.

## Assigning a primary specialty
- Last authors are classified by specialty and mapped based on their institutional affiliation.
- A primary clinical specialty of **Cardiology** or **Radiology** is manually assigned based on an automated google search with the following query:

    > `{author-name} {author-affiliation-city} cardiac MRI CV`
- Where identified, any of the following is screened: 
  - ResearchGate and/or LinkedIn profile
  - Curriculum vitae 
  - Institutional webpage

  Non-clinical authors are assigned a "**Non-MD scientist**" status, while those unidentified remain "**Unassigned**".
