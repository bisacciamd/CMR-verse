# Methods
- Systematic search of all CMR-related studies indexed on [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) as of `r Sys.Date()`
- Search restricted to 
  - top 10% journals in cardiology and radiology on the [Scopus database](https://www.scopus.com/)
  - first and last authors with > 1 CMR-related publications.

# Journals
- A total of `r nrow(journals_card)` journals in the *Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine* category, and `r nrow(journals_rad)` journals in the *Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging* category were identified as the top 10% journals in their respective category out of `r nrow(journals_all)` journals in these categories.
 - of these, `r nrow(journals_all_CMR)` journals had articles related to CMR.

# Papers
- Between 2019 and 2024, a total of `r results$Articles` CMR-related papers were published. Of these, `r nrow(papers_cmr)` (`r round(nrow(papers_cmr) / papers_n * 100, digits = 1)`%) were published in top 10% journals by a total of `r length(first_authors_cmr_unique)` unique first authors and `r length(last_authors_cmr_unique)` unique last authors.
